= About

This is a set of scripts you can use to automate certain Basecamp tasks. For
example for automatically posting weekly activity planners or automatically
uploading files from your scanner device.

= The scripts

== weekly_activity.rb

This script posts a message into a Basecamp project which asks all people to
post their activity for the coming week in the comments. Good for an overview
when working on a team spanning multiple projects!
